# QuantumConnect
QuantumConnect is an open-source peer-to-peer messaging app created for the course Software Engineering I at Rowan University. It makes use of the quantum-safe Kyber Crystals algorithm for key exchange, and traditional AES encryption for message encoding. There is planned support for command interpretation, mini games, and hopefully a mobile release by the end of the semester.
